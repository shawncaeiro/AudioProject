<p>Audio source separation is a well known problem in the field of signal processing. In class, we implemented the REPET algorithm so separate foreground vocal from background music. In this project, we test many other source separation algorithms and test them against different genres of music. Our final deliverable that will be able to take in a musical piece of a certain genre and separate the audio based on the best algorithm for that genre.</p>

<p>There has been much literature in the field of source separation, with many algorithms that have been implemented for source separation. The following papers have influenced our work so far, showcasing different algorithms that have been used to separate sources.</p>

<p>The first step was researching the prominent algorithms in the industry. We found many different algorithms and went through a feasibility analysis of trying to implement the algorithms in Python. After researching which algorithms were feasible, we focused on REPET, non negative matrix factorization, robust principal component analysis, truncated SVD, and Factor Analysis as source separation algorithms. We then implemented each of those algorithms in Python code and tested on various pieces of music. Each algorithm worked decently well on some pieces of music while failed on other snippets.</p>

<h3>
<a id="next-steps" class="anchor" href="#next-steps" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Our next steps include a more rigorous test of different types of genres of music on the different source separating algorithms. Based on that analysis, we will have our results for which separators work best for which genres of music and will be able to mock up a simple application that source separates an audio file based on the genre of music. </p>
